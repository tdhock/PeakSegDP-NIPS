PeakSeg: Peak detection via constrained optimal Segmentation

This repository contains the code to make the results from the 4-page
paper and poster accepted for presentation at the
[[http://www.mlcb.org/previous/mlcb2014/machine-learning-in-computational-biology][NIPS
2014 workshop on machine learning in computational biology]].

To make sure to use the same package versions, please install the
=works_with_R= function by copying the code in [[file:works_with.R]] to
your ~/.Rprofile which will load it at the beginning of every R
session.

Then type "make" to run the code. There are two big steps:

1. Download the ChIP-seq benchmark data set from
   http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/chip-seq-chunk-db/

2. Run the https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegDP algorithm on each
   profile in the benchmark.

On my computer it took about 1 week (using one 1.6GHz CPU) to run the
PeakSegDP algorithm on all the profiles in the benchmark.
